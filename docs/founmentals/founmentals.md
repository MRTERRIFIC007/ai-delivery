MAKE THE HAS UTILIE HAS POSSIBLE




there is also atlas mongo : mongodb+srv://admin:<db_password>@cluster0.0pn8t.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0 
id:admin
password:admin
the hope is to integrate with twilo for otp integration and sign in/auth in few days so deveolp the project accordingly dont integrate it with mongo rn if it is going to cause problem later for twilo

make it has quick has possible

CREATE A FOUNDMENTALS_TRUTH file for the things you have done foundamentaly since you hallucination a lot it is help in staying near to the truth while creating the project

i think has of now your foundnations are pretty weaak if the base is pretty weak it is going to cause promblem for maiking the building on it so CREATE THE PRETTY STRONG FOUNDADATIONS and MAKE THE FUTURE DEVEOPEMMENT  ALIGN WITH FOUNDATIONS AND DONT GET DISTRACTED FROM IT or hallucated from it


now CREATE ANOTHER FOLDER NAME DEVEPLMENT AND FIRST TELL ME WHAT ARE YOU DOING AND THEN IMPLETEMENT

get the habit of pushing it to github repo after every change and when told it is stable version push it to NAMED STABLE version and push it



THERE CURRENTLY ERRORS IN RUNNING BACKEND fix it

Based on my analysis of the codebase, there are several critical issues preventing proper AI model integration:

## Port Mismatch in AI Service Configuration

- Backend checks for AI services at `http://localhost:5015` and `http://localhost:5017`
- This mismatch means the backend will never successfully connect to AI services

## Missing Data Pipeline

- No proper data flow from frontend to AI prediction services
- Customer coordinates (latitude, longitude) aren't properly passed to the AI model
- Missing validation for geographic data before processing

## AI Service Integration Gaps

- No proper error handling when AI services are unavailable
- No fallback mechanism to handle prediction failures
- Missing retry logic for transient failures

## Implementation Issues with Time Slot Prediction

- The specific customer data (CUST102, lat: 17.490005, long: 78.504004) can't be processed because:
  1. The prediction model likely expects standardized input format
  2. No data transformation layer between frontend and AI service
  3. Commercial address type classification not properly passed to the model

## Interface Problems

- Backend health checks only verify if AI services are running
- No proper API gateway pattern for AI service communication
- Prediction results aren't properly formatted for frontend consumption

## Frontend-Backend Communication Issues

- Frontend likely makes direct API calls without proper error handling
- No loading states or user feedback during prediction process
- Missing data validation before submission

The most critical issue is the port and URL mismatch. The backend is looking for AI services on different ports than where they're actually running, making integration impossible. Additionally, there's no proper data transformation layer to prepare customer data for AI model consumption or process the results for display.

## Model Integration Issues

- AI prediction code is isolated in Python files without proper API endpoints
- No standardized request/response format between backend and AI services
- Missing serialization/deserialization logic for model inputs/outputs

## Data Processing Problems

- Customer data (CUST102, lat: 17.490005, long: 78.504004) isn't properly structured for model input
- Commercial address type not properly encoded as categorical variable for model consumption
- Missing preprocessing steps to normalize geographical coordinates

## Backend Service Communication

- Backend uses direct HTTP requests to AI services without proper abstraction
- No circuit breaker pattern to handle AI service failures
- Missing service discovery mechanism

## Request/Response Format Inconsistencies

- AI model expects array inputs but likely receives object format
- Response data from AI model not properly formatted for frontend consumption
- No schema validation for AI service inputs/outputs

## Hardcoded Configuration

- Hardcoded URLs for AI services (`http://localhost:5015`) in multiple places
- No proper configuration management for service endpoints
- Missing environment-specific settings

## Error Handling Deficiencies

- Backend doesn't properly propagate AI service errors to frontend
- No meaningful error messages for prediction failures
- Missing logging for debugging AI service integration issues

## Authentication & Authorization Issues

- AI services lack proper authentication
- No rate limiting for prediction requests
- Missing access control for sensitive prediction endpoints

## Time Slot Algorithm Implementation Flaws

- Time slot prediction algorithm likely doesn't account for commercial address types
- No consideration for business hours in commercial location predictions
- Algorithm may not be optimized for the specific geographic region (17.49, 78.50)

## Frontend Implementation Problems

- Frontend form doesn't validate coordinate inputs
- No progress indicators during prediction process
- UI doesn't gracefully handle prediction failures

## Missing Monitoring and Diagnostics

- No telemetry to track prediction successes/failures
- Missing metrics collection for model performance
- No observability into the prediction pipeline

The core issue is that the system is built as separate components without proper integration points. The customer data (CUST102 with coordinates 17.490005, 78.504004 and Commercial address type) can't flow through the system because of these disconnected services and improper data transformation between components.

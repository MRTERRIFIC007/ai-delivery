# OptiDeliver - India Post Delivery Optimization System Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for the OptiDeliver project, designed specifically to address the delivery optimization needs of India Post. The system aims to transform India Post's delivery process by implementing time slot selection, AI-powered delivery predictions, and enhanced customer experience.

## Context and Problem Statement

India Post faces several challenges in its delivery process:

1. **Fixed Delivery Hours**: Postmen attempt deliveries between 10am-5pm, which often conflicts with recipients' working hours.
2. **Failed Delivery Attempts**: When recipients aren't available, postmen must make second attempts or leave notifications, wasting valuable working hours.
3. **Customer Dissatisfaction**: Recipients must take leave from work to collect items, leading to frustration.
4. **Return to Sender**: Many items are returned to sender due to recipient unavailability, decreasing delivery performance.
5. **Competitive Disadvantage**: E-commerce platforms and financial institutions offer time-slot deliveries, creating higher customer expectations.

## Project Vision

OptiDeliver will revolutionize India Post's delivery system by:

1. Allowing senders to select preferred delivery time slots during booking
2. Enabling recipients to modify time slots before delivery
3. Using AI to learn from delivery patterns and optimize future deliveries
4. Integrating last-mile delivery optimization into the booking process
5. Providing real-time tracking and notifications to all stakeholders
